# iNAP
A java based "Chat-bot" application made in NetBeans.
## Functionalities
User can engage in general conversation with the application. When the user mentions an unfamilliar word, they are then asked what that word means. The user can then explain this word and when it is brought up again in conversation, the application will recall what it means.

Information about the user is stored into a file that is updated through conversation. Information included are things like what the user prefers to be called, their friends, people they dislike, interests, and least favorite things to do.

If the user shows signs of sadness, the application responds accordingly and prompts the user to discuss how they feel.

Words that the program learns are saved in a file, as are words that the program already knows.
